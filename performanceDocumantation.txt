The performance.php file allows coaches to track and visualize the performance of users. 
Coaches can input performance data, view it in a table, and see a graph of how the performance changes over time.
Main Features
1. Form for Submitting Performance Data:
It provides a form where a coach can enter data like the metric name, its value, and the date it was measured.
The form uses a POST request to send this data to the server and save it in the database.
2. Data Validation:
Metric: This field cannot be left empty. A valid metric must be entered.
Value: The value must be a positive number.
Date: If the date is not provided, the system automatically uses the current date.
3. Database Interaction:
The performance data entered by the coach is saved into the performance table in the database using prepared statements, which makes the process secure by preventing SQL injection attacks.
Once the data is successfully saved, the page reloads and shows the newly added data.
4. Displaying Performance Data:
The system fetches and displays the performance data for a user in a table.
Chart.js is used to display the data as a graph, so the coach can visually see how the performance has changed over time.
5. User Role Control:
Only users with the role "coach" are allowed to access the page and submit performance data.
