This file allows coaches to track the attendance of players for different events.
Coaches can select an event, mark players as present, absent, or late, and save the attendance data in the database.

Main Features
Event Selection:

The file provides a dropdown where the coach can select an event. 
The events are listed in the order of the most recent event first.
If an event is selected, the page displays the list of players for that event.
Attendance Submission:
After selecting the event, the coach can mark each player's attendance as present, absent, or late using radio buttons.
The coach then submits the form, and the attendance data is saved in the database.
Handling Duplicates:
If a player's attendance for the selected event already exists, the system will update the status instead of adding a new record.
Prefilling Existing Attendance Data:
If attendance data already exists for the selected event, 
the system pre-fills the attendance statuses for each player.
